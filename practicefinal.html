					<h3>Background</h3>
  			</div> </p>
					<p>Numerous reports have been done on the series of abuses committed at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement centers. Since being started by the Department of Homeland Security after the 2001 9/11 attack on the twin towers, I.C.E has continually been critiqued and protested against for the conditions at their centers <a> </a>. Under former U.S. President Barack Obama's term in office, the facilities were remarked upon for not being ideal, but were viewed more as prison camps as the primary makeup in them was immigrants with criminal status. The following president, former President Donald J. Trump, changed this precendent, forcing higher levels of imprisonment and stirring more outrage against the system. Under President Trump's term, in some areas, as many as 65% of detainees had no criminal charges on their records. ICE has been spotlighted in the public eye for reports of providing inadequate accomodations for <a href="https://www.americanoversight.org/investigation/conditions-in-migrant-detention-centers"> illegal immigrants,</a> including overcrowded and filthy housing, insufficient amounts of food, and cruel treatment from the detainment officers. In one particular instance, a male gynecologist at a Georgia detention center continued to be employed even after <a href="https://time.com/5924021/women-lawsuit-irwin-detention-ice/">coercing women into invasive procedures</a> that they did not understand nor need. All of the aforementioned actions have led to numerous tragic and untimely deaths. At the same time, I.C.E officers are being questioned on the whereabouts of children who have mysteriously gone missing at the border.  </p>
					<p>Within this firestorm of allegations, there is a serious issue that has not received the same ample amount of discussion. This hellhole of abuse has allegedly also been sexually violent. Worst of all, many of the allegations are detainees against their detainment officers. All reported allegations of sexaul assault at facilities owned by the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, have been released <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17MrjF46o5ZgKByrqiajpykTiYTKuYFSM9uaJLrpMdmc/edit#gid=0"> to public record.</a> The incidents recorded took place from January 1st, 2014 to April 27th, 2018. The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 is supposed to punish abusers, therefore, discouraging sexual assault from occurring in correctional facilities. The PREA formally went through in 2014, the year this dataset begins. This dataset proves that ICE is not doing enough to protect prisoners from both their fellow detainees and the staff. </p>
					<p>The frequency of the assaults and the amount committed by "trusted" officers shows the normalization of rape culture in these detainment camps. It is clear that the background checks performed for employment in these camps is far from adequate. The punishment to detainees who behave unseemly is clearly also not enough to prevent it from happening at the camps. Innocent women and children kept in custody are not being protected from abusers, partially because this abuse begins right at the top.

					<h3>Statistics on Cycle of Abuse</h3>
					<p> <strong> <i> Not a single case is "open" at the moment. 100% were dropped. </strong> </i> </p>
					<p> Nearly 25%, or 1/4th of sexual assault cases in I.C.E. facilities are staff on detainee. The staff members were placed in positions of power over the detainees and clearly took advantage of this power. </p>

					<p> There were 866 cases of detainee on detainee sexual assault. This shows that not only were the officers committing these atrocities, but the detainees too, showing how normalized it had become. </p>

					<p> 76 allegations in 2014, 314 allegations in 2017 and the first four months of 2018, meaning there was a 3.1% increase in sexual assault allegations from 2014 to 2017/early 2018. This lines up with the years of the Trump adminstration (2017-2021), showing the actions he took did have an impact on the fostering of rape culture within the detainment centers. </p>

					<p> Pinal, AZ (138 allegations), San Bernardino, CA (73 allegations), and Frio, TX (64 allegations) were the three cities with the highest amount of sexual assault allegations. Surprisingly the cities with the highest amount of I.C.E. sexual assault allegations were not the most populated cities. </p>

					<p> There are far too many limitations on the dataset released by I.C.E. This dataset does not take into account the sexual assault allegations in ICE detainment centers occurring after April 27th, 2018, meaning it is unclear if the impact of a new President and the ongoing pandemic had an impact on this prevalent issues. It is also unlear if there were any follow-ups with the survivors or if their abusers were removed from their presence to avoid future attacks. Several survivors in the document reported that they were assualted multiple times by the same officers. How could this have changed if the officer was removed from their presence after the first assault. This particular dataset also lacks knowledge on the ages of the survivors. This is important as there have been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/us/immigrant-children-sexual-abuse.html"> reports of children </a> being molested by officers. It is also unknown if the staff members who assaulted detainees were fired. It unfortunately seems as though detainment officers are only fired if there is enough public outrage to spark movement from the higher-ups. </p>

					<h3>A Discussion with the Daughter of an Immigrant</h3>
					<p>For her entire life, 19-year-old Mia Gutarra watched her parents risk deportation every time they walked out the door. "We were always afraid that they were going to get pulled over while driving, and then just be gone," Mia said. Her parents immigrated from Peru over two decades ago, escaping ongoing violence and corruption in hopes of providing a better life for their future family.</p>
					<p>After coming to the states, Mia's parents Juan and Linda, received custodian jobs at Harvard University. They continuously instilled a hard-working mentality into the minds of their two young daughters. Mia said she saw them fully taking advantage of the infamous "American Dream." “Everybody here is about that American dream. Everybody here is about like the opportunities that you can get here in the United States and they were willing to take the risk and possibly come back to nothing," Mia said. Juan and Linda could've never imagined the full-circle moment that was to come in return for their years of hard work. Their eldest daughter Adnil received a full-ride to the prestigious Harvard University they have spent decades working at as custodians. "I get so jealous that Adnil can call me and be like 'Oh I saw Mom on campus today!'" Mia said. </p>
		
					<p> Would they take back any of their years of grueling work? It doesn't seem likely after speaking to the patriarch Juan Gutarra. "Everything I do is for my daughters," Juan said. Several weeks ago, Juan was approved for his citizenship. This means that, after 23 years, both of Mia's parents are officially United States citizens. “It was such a relief seeing that my parents can freely go do things now," Mia said on this life changing advancement. Much fear has been lifted off their shoulders, but the Gutarra's are simply one of thousands of suffering families, and most do not get this lucky. </p>
					<p> Mia discussed many of the issues she herself has seen over time with the system. Her parents both flew into America legally and over-extended their Visas, meaning they were never trapped at an I.C.E facility. "It is absolutely horrifying what they do to people there. You hear cases of young kids going missing and how they are treating women and it makes you want to scream," Mia expressed. When asked what she would like to see change, Mia swiftly had an answer. “I wish there was an easier system to be like I want to become a resident, I want to become a U.S. citizen...More streamlined or like an application you can apply for right when we get here. Like I’m seeking refuge or asylum. So you can apply right off the bat instead of spending years in hiding, waiting to be told you can apply.” The immigration system may be overwhelmed, but in Mia's mind, there is never a reason for the violation of human rights. 

						<p> There are horror stories with all aspects of immigration though, meaning even the fly-in method is not safe from persectution. Mia recounted an instance with a family friend, who flew in and within months, was pulled over for speeding and sent to his home country for four years. He spent that time trying desperately to appeal so he could return home and not miss any more of his son's childhood. Although free from being plagued by the system, Mia said she still worries about the lives of others of those still stuck in the system. “I think that the immigration system needs to be improved also so that kids don’t have to go through that. Seeing your parents suffer,  I wouldn’t wish that on anyone,” Mia said. </p>

			<h3>But what's next?</h3>
			<p>Current U.S. President Joe Biden is hoping to return America's treatment of immigrants to how it was in the Obama era, when Biden was Vice President. Biden's officials say that I.C.E will now only be prioritizing the arrests of serious criminals, rather than families merely trying to get by. Biden's campagin website promised to "modernize America's immigration system" as Biden pledged to undo nearly all of Trump's immigration restrictions. In 2021, arrest totals were half of what they were under Trump's administration. It is unknown how much this statistic was affected by the ongoing pandemic. Biden has never publicly commented on the sexual assaults in I.C.E detention centers. However he did state, in July of 2021, that <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/02/statement-of-president-joe-biden-on-the-results-of-the-independent-review-commission-on-military-sexual-assault/"> "eliminating sexual assault" </a> has been a "priority" of his during his time in public serivce. </p>
			<p>Diligence in remaining informed on this issue is still of the utmost importance though as many understand that a new president does not necessarily mean immediate better treatment of immigrants. Biden stood by Obama's side in the deportation of millions and was accused himself of sexual assault by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html." > former employee. </a> "[Immigration] advocates need to be clear-eyed that a Biden Administration does not automatically bring about comprehensive immigration reform,” said <a href="https://time.com/5909571/joe-biden-immigration-policy/"> Tom Wong, </a> an associate professor of political science at the University of California San Diego.  </p>
			<p> <strong> <i> The way to stop these abuses from happening is to stay informed about them. Public outrage is the only way to ensure the end of human rights violations. </i> </strong> </p>
